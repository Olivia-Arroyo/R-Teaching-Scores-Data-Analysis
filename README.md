# Teaching Scores Data Analysis
An R data analysis project examining differences in instructor teaching scores.


## I. Questions
- Do instructors with higher "beauty" scores also have higher or lower teaching evaluations?
- Could it be that there is no relationship between "beauty" score and teaching evaluations?

## II. Collect Data
For this data analysis data was extracted from end of semester student evaluations for a sample of 463 courses taught by 94 professors from the University of Texas at Austin(https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=evals). In addition, six students rate the professors' physical appearance. The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and each column has information on either the course or the professor.
